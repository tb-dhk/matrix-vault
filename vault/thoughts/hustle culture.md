i would just like to preface this by saying this was originally written as a practice gp essay. i have since rearranged it for my own purposes.

the question was: **to what extent has hustle culture been detrimental to your society?**

hustle culture pisses me the fuck off. its gradual but steady rise in the past few years is the culmination of years and decades of people desperately trying to climb the social ladder, especially in singapore where everyone is kiasu as hell. the thing about hustle culture, though, is that it's built almost purely on peer pressure, and even no one is outright pressuring you to perform like them, you feel left behind anyway. no one is safe from this epidemic of anxiety-induced panic work. 

i feel like most people here are familiar with influencer ashton hall's viral **six-hour pre-work morning routine**. starting at 0350, he does a bunch of facial cold plunges and intense workout sessions, ending at 0930. i don't know how anyone does that. i personally could never. of course, most people point to his video as an extreme of hustle culture, something to be laughed at and parodied instead of taken seriously. but hustle culture is still very real, even if most people aren't spending a quarter of the day doing shit before work.

sometimes hustle culture is praised for promoting discipline and motivation. which, it does, but also i think we should be more worried about the toxicity that it can bring into society and the damage it does to your well-being. it's a trade-off. **a really really bad trade-off.**

before we begin, though, i should probably just define what hustle culture is. hustle culture is a mindset that prioritises working excessively hard, while sacrificing well-being and work-life balance for the sake of constant productivity.

with this definition in mind, the first problem is very obvious: hustle culture glorifies toxic standards that push people to neglect their health. people may cut down their sleep to just a few hours or even burn the midnight oil just to get more shit done, all while their health is put on the back-burner. ironically enough, despite hustle culture being all about productivity, not sleeping and resting enough is usually gonna fuck with your mind, and, by extension, how well you work. when that happens, instead of stopping to rest, some people might just feel like they have to work even more so they can stay productive, which is crazy to me because. your body has a limit. you can't go on forever.

hustle culture affects more than just the body. it also does severe damage to your mindset. many people, through hustle culture, have come to internalise the idea that not working is bad, and this includes me. like i will literally be taking a break doing something *relatively useless* and the siren in my brain is blaring because i have other *better* things to do. this is actually called productivity guilt, and it's highly linked to anxiety.

a quote that has been used often by many people to rationalize this mindset is "you have the same 24 hours as beyoncé", a reference to how the famous singer-songwriter gained extreme amounts of fame and success through hard work and dedication. this quote promotes the mindset that anyone can be successful as long as they put in enough work, but it does not take into account the fact that people come from different backgrounds and circumstances, or that beyoncé might not be in the best of health either. basically, more often than not, you do **not** have the same 24 hours as beyoncé. with these almost unattainable expectations, people usually burn out way before they can reach their goals. all of this might cause one to have an unhealthy, or even toxic, relationship with one's work, if that relationship is not already completely destroyed.

the most insidious part of hustle culture is how it feeds into itself. hustle culture is based on the idea that most people are not working enough to keep up with everyone else in our competitive society. comparison and peer pressure are literally **baked** into this culture. as time passes, people become more and more competitive and try to outdo each other, gradually raising the threshold for what is considered a normal amount of work. overachieving soon becomes normal or even the bare minimum.

even with all those drawbacks, some people still argue that hustle culture has its benefits. it builds discipline and motivation, and helps people to become more driven. and this is not wrong. but also how is any of that going to justify fucking up your physical and mental state? there are **so many** other ways to build up discipline and drive while maintaining a healthy mindset. instead of, you know, relying on a culture that builds motivation through anxiety. there is no point in gaining discipline if it comes at the expense of physical and mental well-being.

hustle culture is incredibly detrimental to society. it glorifies so many incredibly toxic standards, damages people's relationships with work, and slowly feeds into itself to worsen the problems it causes. **may we all break free from this toxic culture before it runs us into the fucking ground.**
