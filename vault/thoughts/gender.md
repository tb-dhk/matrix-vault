description: like genuinely why are we making shit up

i'm just gonna get straight to the point. can we stop pretending gender roles are inherent to how society works?

like why? why do we make separations between men and women, between boys and girls? why are we doing this to anyone? to *ourselves*? why do we always group them together when we compare how they behave? why do we reduce the multitude of men and women, each with unique personalities, to a binary of monoliths?

"you're a boy. you should stop acting sissy." shut up! gender's not real! let me be a sissy fag if i want to!

"i don't know how to talk to girls because i'm a boy." you are both people! just talk normally! it is **not that fucking hard**!

why are we even so strict with these labels? are there inherent qualities to people that i don't understand? why do i have to be a man? why can't i just not?

i never really fit in with anyone that well. in primary school, i used to hang out with girls all the time because i was too different from the guys. but even with the girls, there was some social barrier that kept me from becoming closer with them. 

i don't know how to explain this to anyone. there's many people who are nice to me, but they don't feel like *my people*. we're just too different to be that close. i don't really feel that strong of a connection to them. but on the other hand, i've always wanted be one of the girls so fucking bad.

i just want "the girls" (anyone who considers themself to be a "girl", regardless of gender identity) to like me. and to accept me like one of their own. sometimes i feel like there are girls who are really excited to talk to other girls but then i come over and their face suddenly goes black. like what did i even do to you? what am i doing wrong in general? i thought these were going to be the people that would accept me because i was so much more like them. but i guess not. maybe it's because i'm ugly and i have a male body.

sure, i have friends, but i mostly talk to them online, and we don't have time to meet up often. in real life, i'm usually isolated. everyone is living their lives normally and i'm the one *woke bitch* who's screaming into an empty room, because **i'm the only one who can feel the existential horror of everyone believing and making peace with something that isn't real**.

i feel like i don't live in the same reality as most people do. like there's something fundamentally different to who i am. i feel like everything and everyone is alienating, because i'm too different to fully relate or understand anyone. the world is shoving everyone into boxes and i don't fit in a single one of them. so i'm just kind of there, outside of the spaces where everyone else lives.

it's like everyone is stuck in a rigid and gendered world that i don't want to engage in. and in this world, everyone is the same, but not remotely similar to me. it feels like no one will ever understand. 

and everytime someone tells me to be a man, or that i'm going to become a man, or that i'm too sissy, i want to grab them by the fucking throat and scream:
> I DON'T WANT TO BE A FUCKING MAN
> NONE OF THIS IS REAL
> WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE SEEING THIS
> LEAVE ME ALONE

is this even a problem about gender? maybe i'm the problem. maybe i just have too many issues and i'm too different. no one else has these issues anyway. or maybe i'm just ugly and no one wants to look at me. maybe i should suck it up and be miserable forever.

i don't know anymore.
