description: like genuinely why are we making shit up

i'm just gonna get straight to the point. can we stop pretending gender roles are inherent to how society works?

like why? why do we make separations between men and women, between boys and girls? why are we doing this to anyone? to *ourselves*? why do we always group them together when we compare how they behave? why do we reduce the multitude of men and women, each with unique personalities, to a binary of monoliths?

"you're a boy. you should stop acting sissy" shut up! gender's not real! let me be a sissy fag if i want to!

"i don't know how to talk to girls because i'm a boy" you are both people! just talk normally! it is **not that fucking hard!**

why are we even so strict with these labels? are there inherent qualities to people that i don't understand? why do i have to be a man? why can't i just not?

i feel like i don't live in the same reality as most people do. like there's something fundamentally different to who i am. i feel like everything and everyone is alienating, because i'm too different to fully relate or understand anyone. 

it's like everyone is stuck in a rigid and gendered world that i don't want to engage in. and in this world, everyone is the same, but not remotely similar to me. it feels like no one will ever understand.

i never really fit in with anyone that well. in primary school, i used to hang out with girls all the time because i was too different from the guys. but even with the girls, there was some social barrier that kept me from becoming closer with them. 

i don't know how to explain this to anyone. i wanna be one of the girls so fucking bad, but without necessarily identifying as female. i just want "the girls" (anyone who considers themself to be "a girl", regardless of gender identity) to like me. and to accept me like one of their own. sometimes i feel like there are girls who are really excited to talk to other girls but then i come over and their face suddenly goes black. like what did i even do to you? what am i doing wrong in general?

i feel like i'm going to be lonely forever. sure, i have friends, but i mostly talk to them online, and we dont have time to meet up often. in real life, i'm usually isolated.
