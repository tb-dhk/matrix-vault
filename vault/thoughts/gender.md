i'm just gonna get straight to the point. can we stop pretending gender roles are inherent to how society works?

like why? why do we make separations between men and women, between boys and girls? why are we doing this to anyone? to *ourselves*? why do we always group them together when we compare how they behave? why do we reduce the multitude of men and women, each with unique personalities, to a binary of monoliths?

"you're a boy. you should stop acting sissy" shut up! gender's not real! let me be a sissy fag if i want to!

"i don't know how to talk to girls because i'm a boy" you are both people! just talk normally! it is **not that fucking hard!**

why are we even so strict with these labels? are there inherent qualities to people that i don't understand? why do i have to be a man? why can't i just not?
