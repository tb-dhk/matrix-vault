# background
this project is something i've been thinking about for a **very** long time. i've always been very fascinated by *tripleS'* concept, and i was a huge fan of them from around 2022-2024. i always liked the idea of having each member come in one at a time (or if you're nxtglow, in groups of four), which was similar to *LOONA*'s concept (also a huge fan before i moved to tripleS). but i think the most interesting part was always the fan-voted units, and the different combinations.
# history
i've made a few tripleS games. the first webgame i made was called *generation.SSS*. it was basically an antimatter dimensions dupe, and was really shitty. i then tried to make a new game called we are 1, but i quit over being frustrated with javascript. unfortunately that's still not something i've been able to avoid completely, but i've gotten much better at the language.

the inspiration for this game came from games like monthly idol and monthly entertainment, which i am a huge fan of. however, i didn't like how costly it was to change group lineups, the member limits, as well as the focus on styling, which i was personally not interested in. this was what motivated me to work on *we are 1* the first time. a few months ago, i picked up monthly entertainment for the first time in a few years, i was reminded of why i started on the game to begin with. and that's how i restarted work on *we are 1*.
# creative choices
the name *we are 1* comes from the line "우리는 하나이자 스물넷입니다" (we are 1 and also 24) which appears in some of *tripleS*' earlier videos, specifically [thesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVrdkrqpBV4&list=PLZlIsCBsz6M0I5DuGDIHVhfALg3-jFG-5&index=9) and [we are S](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJncmkjxOEs&list=PLZlIsCBsz6M0I5DuGDIHVhfALg3-jFG-5&index=8).

the main focus of the game is, simply put, training idols and managing their careers. more complicatedly put, it involves scouting trainees and staff, managing schedules forming groups and units as well as managing releases. at the moment, only trainees and staff are implemented.
# features
0.0.1 came out a while back, but i'm only writing about the process now because i've only just made the platform to do so. you can play this incredibly unfinished version [here](https://we-are-1.tbdhk.xyz).
## trainees
the thing about these simulation games is that everyone needs to have stats. trainees in particular have a LOT of stats. for this game, i borrowed from monthly entertainment for stat names.

every trainee has the following stats:
- profile
	- name
	- age
	- gender
- idol
	- vocal
	- dance
	- rap
	- perf.
- creative
	- prod.
	- lyrics
	- video.
	- choreo.
- ent.
- metrics
	- health
	- passion
	- happiness
	- trust

trainee ranks are based on a weighted sum of idol, creative and entertainment skills, with idol having the largest weight. lower scores are more common during auditioning, but trainees can be trained to slowly increase in rank.
## staff
there are only two types of staff at the moment: trainers and managers. there can only be one trainer for each skill (mainly to avoid having to manage multiple trainers).
## audition page
this was mostly a matter of figuring out how to do a skewed binomial distribution around a certain value. there are several kinds of auditions that can be done, with only the first kind unlocked at level 0. each kind of audition has a different energy cost and price, but higher costs may also reap higher returns in terms of skill level.
## hiring page
similar to the audition page but more for staff. there are only two options, trainer and manager.
## scheduling
this is the feature i'm the most proud of. how this works is that by default, every trainee enters the default scheduling group. (customisation of scheduling groups will be added later, for higher levels.) from there, you can plan their week out on a 5x3 grid. each activity will have a bearing on their skills and metrics.

## passage of time
when you press the y/m/w button on the top right corner, one week passes and all the trainees go through the schedule you've assigned. the hardest part of this was calculating all the metrics together, accounting for overflow on metrics like happiness and health, etc. it was a whole lot.
# what's coming next?
i plan to include the following in 0.0.2:
- improved ui/ux
	- hovering over actions shows their bearing on metrics and skills
- new features
	- trainees
		- new types of auditions
		- trainee groups
	-  artists
		- formation of groups
		- formation of units (by company)
		- releasing music
		- sns

i don't have a planned release date for the full game yet, but i plan to finish 0.0.2 by august or september, and get a working 0.1.0 (all planned basic features) by the end of 2025. the skewed timeline is mostly due to the fact that i have school for the next four months.
