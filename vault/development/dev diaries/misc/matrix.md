hi! this is my first actual post on ***matrix***, my new digital garden. this is a project that i spent a few days on. here are some questions i figured would be helpful.
# what is ***matrix*** and why did you make it?
***matrix*** is a digital garden, a place where i can put my ideas and possibly expand on them.

i made ***matrix*** because i always wanted to have a blog where i could publish my thoughts, but i hated the idea of putting everything on a pre-made website like wix or (grimaces) blogger dot com...

i also wanted more freedom on the design and layout, and i wanted to be able to make it unique.
# how does ***matrix*** work?
***matrix*** is a website made with react router (frontend) and an obsidian vault (backend). both are hosted on vercel, the latter as a blob.

in simpler terms, i made the website with react, and the posts in obsidian. then i put both of these onto vercel to let everyone enjoy!
# why not use obsidian sync or a similar digital garden maker?
similar reasons for why i didn't just use wix or blogger - i didn't like the idea of having a pre-made layout. i wanted something basic and simple, not optimised for efficiency. i wanted it to feel cozy, raw and personal to me.
# if this is *your* personal blog, how are other people supposed to use it?
it's really up to the user. this isn't necessarily for other people, but sometimes i have things i have to say that i feel like might be useful to share to the world. it's also good to have this platform to host long documents like statements that i feel like i want to have full control over.
# i found a bug!
please let me know. contact me directly through any means (discord at tbdhk is preferred).
# what is the "help" page for?
i thought it would be cool to have a few "lore documents". leave me alone.

that said, all of the "lore documents" will be under the [origin tag](/tags/origin).
